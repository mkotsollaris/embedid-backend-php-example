# PHP Restful API Starter Kit

This is an example of how to create a backend utilizing PHP.

You will need to insert your public and API key inside api.php (line 15 and 24) and index.html (line 11).

You can run the project by executing the bash script:

```
./start.sh
```

Note that EmbedID requires an GET endpoint 'trulioo-api/embedids/tokens' to be added on your application. You will have to configure that endpoint on your server.
